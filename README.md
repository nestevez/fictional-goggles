DBT skills website app 

This webapp is meant to provide structured guided exercises for those struggling with mental health using DBT skills. 

MVP:
- complete check-ins using a dedicated form (perhaps similar to that used commonly by therapeutic programs)
- schedule such check-ins
- view the data collected over time
- crisis resource page

Future:
- data is charted over time, not just displayed
- showing insights regarding correlations between skills and recorded emotions
- learning skills through the app, including scheduled homework assignments
- attempt to diversify user's use of skills by suggesting skills based on check-ins
- mindfulness exercises (guided meditations, movements, etc)
- art therapy prompts
- therapeutic "paths" based on diagnosis
